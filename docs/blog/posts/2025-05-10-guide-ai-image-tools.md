# Quick-guide on Local Stable-Diffusion Toolkits for macOS

Running generative-AI models on-device means zero cloud costs, no upload limits, and full control of your checkpoints. Below is a quick guide to five of the most popular macOS-ready front-ends and launchers.

<!-- more -->

## 1. ComfyUI

- **Download:** [https://www.comfy.org/download](https://www.comfy.org/download)
- **What it is:** A **node-based** graph editor that lets you wire together samplers, LoRA loaders, ControlNet, animation nodes and more.
- **Pros**
    - Visual graph makes complex pipelines transparent.
    - Ships with MPS-enabled PyTorch wheels; smooth on M-series Macs.
    - Huge community of custom nodes.
- **Cons**
    - Steeper learning curve than point-and-click UIs.
    - Initial setup still requires Python & Homebrew.

## 2. Stable Diffusion WebUI (AUTOMATIC1111)

- **Download / install guide:** [Installation on Apple Silicon](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Installation-on-Apple-Silicon)
- **What it is:** The de-facto standard web interface, with extensions for almost everything (SDXL, ControlNet, Inpainting, DreamBooth, etc.).
- **Pros**
    - Feature-rich; thousands of extensions & themes.
    - Active development and community support.
- **Cons**
    - Manual, terminal-centric install (Git + Python + brew deps).
    - UI can feel cluttered for newcomers.

## 3. DiffusionBee

- **Download:** [https://diffusionbee.com/download](https://diffusionbee.com/download)
- **What it is:** A **one-click** desktop app bundling Stable Diffusion, optimized for Apple Silicon.
- **Pros**
    - No command line - drag-and-drop install.
    - Pre-bundled models; useful "Upscale" & "Remove BG" tools.
- **Cons**
    - Fewer tuning knobs; limited advanced workflows.
    - Closed binary means slower updates to new samplers.

## 4. InvokeAI

- **Download / quick-start:** [InvokeAI Quick Start](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI/blob/main/docs/installation/quick_start.md)
- **What it is:** A professional-leaning fork of the original "lstein" repo with both CLI and lightweight web UI.
- **Pros**
    - Powerful batch / workflow scripting.
    - Good "Unified Canvas" for sketch-to-image iterations.
- **Cons**
    - Conda-based install (≈4 GB environment).
    - Heavier RAM needs (recommend 16 GB+).

## 5. Fooocus

- **Repo:** [https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus)
- **What it is:** A simplified, Midjourney-style frontend ("just prompt") that auto-downloads models & Loras.
- **Pros**
    - Minimal interface - great for fast idea-sketching.
    - Automatic model & VAE handling.
- **Cons**
    - On-device generation slower on M-series (no discrete GPU).
    - Fewer granular controls than A1111 or ComfyUI.

## Side-by-side snapshot

| Tool               | Install effort          | UI / Workflow           | Apple Silicon speed* | Best for                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **ComfyUI**         | Medium (Python, Homebrew) | Node-graph editor        | ★★★★☆                | Building custom pipelines         |
| **A1111 WebUI**     | High (manual CLI)         | Web tabs + extensions    | ★★★☆☆                | Power users, extensions           |
| **DiffusionBee**    | **One-click DMG**         | Native app panels        | ★★★☆☆                | Beginners, offline "fire-and-forget" |
| **InvokeAI**        | Medium-high (Conda)       | Web + CLI + Canvas       | ★★★☆☆                | Batch scripts, in-painting        |
| **Fooocus**         | Medium (Python zip)       | Minimal prompt box       | ★★☆☆☆                | Fast concepting, MJ-style         |

\*Rating is relative to other Apple-Silicon solutions; all use PyTorch-MPS and run without Nvidia GPUs.

## Which one should you pick?

- **New to Stable Diffusion?** Start with **DiffusionBee** - no terminals, no dependencies.
- **Need maximum control & plug-ins?** Go with **AUTOMATIC1111 WebUI**.
- **Love visual programming or complex workflows (videos, LoRAs, ControlNet chains)?** **ComfyUI** is unmatched.
- **Want a production-friendly canvas and scripting?** **InvokeAI**.
- **Just want Midjourney-like simplicity offline?** **Fooocus**.

Because every app can load the same `.safetensors` checkpoints, you're free to test-drive a few and stick with the one that best matches your creative flow. Happy prompting!
