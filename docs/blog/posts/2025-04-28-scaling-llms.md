# Scaling Large Language Models: Multi-GPU and Multi-Node Strategies in 2025

As LLMs continue to grow in complexity and size, efficient training and inference require leveraging multiple GPUs and, often, multiple systems. This guide explores prevalent strategies and tools in 2025 that facilitate such scalability, incorporating insights from Hugging Face's [Ultra-Scale Playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook).

## 1. Parallelism Techniques

### Data Parallelism (DP)

Each GPU holds a full copy of the model and processes different data batches. Gradients are averaged across GPUs.

- **Use Case**: Suitable for models that fit into a single GPU's memory.
- **Tools**: [PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/ddp.html), [Horovod](https://horovod.ai/).

**Mermaid Diagram:**

    A[Input Data] --> B[Split into Batches]
    B --> C1[GPU 1: Model Copy]
    B --> C2[GPU 2: Model Copy]
    C1 --> D1[Forward & Backward Pass]
    C2 --> D2[Forward & Backward Pass]
    D1 --> E[Gradient Averaging]
    D2 --> E
    E --> F[Model Update]
```

### Tensor Parallelism (TP)

Model tensors (e.g., weight matrices) are split across GPUs. Each GPU computes a portion of the operation.

- **Use Case**: Beneficial when model layers are too large for a single GPU.
- **Tools**: [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM), [NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM).

    B --> C2[GPU 2: Partial Computation]
    C1 --> D[Combine Results]
    C2 --> D
    D --> E[Next Layer]
```

### Pipeline Parallelism (PP)

Model layers are divided among GPUs, and data flows sequentially through them.

- **Use Case**: Effective for very deep models.
- **Tools**: [DeepSpeed's pipeline parallelism](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/pipeline/), [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM).

**Mermaid Diagram**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Data] --> B[GPU 1: Layers 1-4]
    B --> C[GPU 2: Layers 5-8]
    C --> D[GPU 3: Layers 9-12]
    D --> E[Output]
```

### Context Parallelism (CP)

A newer parallelism technique that splits the sequence dimension across GPUs, allowing for processing longer sequences.

- **Use Case**: Training models with very long context windows.
- **Tools**: [Picotron](https://github.com/huggingface/picotron), [Nanotron](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron).

**Mermaid Diagram**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Long Sequence] --> B[Split by Context Length]
    B --> C1[GPU 1: First Segment]
    B --> C2[GPU 2: Second Segment]
    C1 --> D[Combine Results]
    C2 --> D
    D --> E[Next Layer]
```

### Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP)

Extends DP by sharding model states (parameters, gradients, optimizer states) across GPUs to reduce memory footprint.

- **Use Case**: Training very large models that don't fit into a single GPU's memory.
- **Tools**: [PyTorch's FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html), [DeepSpeed's ZeRO](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/zero/).

### Mixture of Experts (MoE)

Only a subset of model parameters (experts) are active during a forward pass, reducing computation.

- **Use Case**: Efficiently scaling models with sparse activation.
- **Tools**: [DeepSpeed-MoE](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/mixture-of-experts/), [GShard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16668).

### 4D Parallelism

Combines all four parallelism techniques (Data, Tensor, Pipeline, and Context) for maximum efficiency.

- **Use Case**: Training extremely large models with long context windows.
- **Tools**: [Picotron](https://github.com/huggingface/picotron), [Nanotron](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron).

## 2. Training Strategies

### Single-Node, Multi-GPU

Ideal for workstations or servers with multiple GPUs connected via high-speed interconnects like [NVLink](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/).

- **Approach**: Combine DP with TP or PP to maximize GPU utilization.
- **Example**:

```sh
deepspeed train.py --deepspeed_config ds_config.json
```

- **Documentation**: [DeepSpeed Getting Started](https://www.deepspeed.ai/getting-started/#running-deepspeed)
- **Tools**: DeepSpeed, PyTorch FSDP.

### Multi-Node, Multi-GPU

Suitable for large-scale training across multiple machines.

- **Approach**: Integrate DP, TP, and PP as needed.
- **Example**:

```sh
deepspeed --hostfile hostfile train.py --deepspeed_config ds_config.json
```

- **Documentation**: [DeepSpeed Multi-Node Training](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/multi-node/)
- **Tools**: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, Horovod.

### 4D Parallelism Training

For training extremely large models with long context windows across multiple nodes.

- **Approach**: Utilize all four parallelism techniques (DP, TP, PP, CP) simultaneously.
- **Example**:

```sh
# Using Picotron
python create_config.py --out_dir tmp --exp_name llama-7B --dp 4 --tp 2 --pp 2 --cp 2 --model_name meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf --grad_acc_steps 32 --mbs 4 --seq_len 8192 --hf_token <HF_TOKEN>
torchrun --nproc_per_node 8 train.py --config tmp/llama-7B/config.json
```
