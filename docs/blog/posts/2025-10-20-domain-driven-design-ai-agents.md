## Why domain-driven design matters for AI agents

AI agent projects fail for a surprising reason: not because the code is bad, but because developers and domain experts can't understand each other. You've seen it—business teams ask for a "policy check" and get back a `process_data()` method. Nobody knows what it does, so requirements drift and systems calcify.

Domain-driven design (DDD) fixes this by putting the **business domain** at the center. Not the database schema. Not the prompt template. The actual real-world process you're trying to model. This alignment delivers three immediate wins:

- **Shared language.** Everyone—product, ops, engineering—uses the same words. When compliance says "refund request", that's what appears in your code, prompts, and documentation.
- **Focused scope.** You build what matters: the core workflows, compliance rules, and critical metrics. Not mountains of glue code that break when requirements shift.
- **Adaptability.** When policies change (and they will), you update one well-defined slice instead of hunting through a monolithic tangle.

This matters most in complex domains where rules evolve constantly—think finance, healthcare, operations, or any regulated industry. DDD gives you a fighting chance to keep up.

---

## Strategic building blocks

DDD isn't one big idea—it's a toolkit of patterns that work together. Here are the core concepts you'll use every day.

### Ubiquitous language

This is the shared vocabulary that shows up everywhere: in meetings, documentation, prompts, and method names. No translation layers between "business speak" and "code speak."

If compliance says "policy check", your method is `run_policy_check()`, not `process_data()`. If doctors say "admit patient", you write `admit_patient()`, not `add_user()`.

```python
class PatientRegistry:
    def admit_patient(self, patient_id: str) -> None:
        """Admit a patient to the registry - term used by medical staff."""
        ...
```

This eliminates translation gaps and makes code self-documenting. When requirements change, the language change is obvious and localized.

### Bounded contexts

Large systems need explicit boundaries. Why? Because the same word means different things in different parts of the business.

Take "product" in e-commerce. In the **Inventory** context, a product is a catalog item with SKUs and stock counts. In the **Billing** context, it's a line item with pricing rules and tax calculations. In **Order Management**, it's a quantity and delivery promise.

Bounded contexts let each subdomain have its own definition without conflict. Translation layers or interfaces connect them when they need to talk.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Order Management<br/>'Product' = order line item] --> D[Translation Layer]
    B[Billing<br/>'Product' = pricing entity] --> D
    C[Inventory<br/>'Product' = stock item] --> D
    classDef ctx fill:#e0f2fe,stroke:#38bdf8,color:#0c4a6e;
    class A,B,C ctx;
```

This keeps each model lean and prevents the "one size fits all" model that becomes unwieldy as complexity grows.

### Entities and value objects

These are the basic building blocks of your domain model. Understanding the difference is key.

**Entities** have identity that persists over time. A `Task` with ID `123` is the same task even if you change its description, status, or due date. Two entities are equal if they have the same ID, regardless of their attributes.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class SupportTicket(BaseModel):
    ticket_id: str  # This is the identity
    customer: str
    issue: str
    status: str = "OPEN"

    def close(self) -> None:
        if self.status != "OPEN":
            raise ValueError("Ticket already closed")
        self.status = "CLOSED"
```

**Value objects** have no identity—they're defined entirely by their attributes. Two `TimeSlot` objects with the same start and end times are interchangeable. Value objects are immutable; instead of changing them, you create new ones.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class TimeSlot(BaseModel):
    start: str  # e.g., "2025-10-18 09:00"
    end: str    # e.g., "2025-10-18 10:00"

    @property
    def duration(self) -> int:
        # Compute duration from start to end
        ...
```

Use entities for things that have lifecycles (`Order`, `User`, `AgentSession`). Use value objects for descriptions and measurements (`EmailAddress`, `Priority`, `Location`).

### Aggregates

Aggregates are clusters of related entities and value objects that get treated as one unit. Think of them as consistency boundaries—within an aggregate, business rules must always hold true.

Every aggregate has one **aggregate root**—an entity that controls access to everything inside. Want to modify something in the aggregate? Go through the root. This enforces invariants and prevents invalid states.

```python
from datetime import date
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Task(BaseModel):
    id: str
    description: str
    completed: bool = False

class Plan(BaseModel):  # This is the aggregate root
    id: str
    tasks: list[Task] = Field(default_factory=list)

    def add_task(self, task: Task) -> None:
        # Business rule enforced here: no duplicate task IDs
        if any(t.id == task.id for t in self.tasks):
            raise ValueError("Task ID already exists")
        self.tasks.append(task)
```

External code never touches the `tasks` list directly—it always calls `add_task()`. This guarantees the "no duplicate IDs" rule can never be violated. When you save to a database, you typically save the entire aggregate at once.

### Repositories

Repositories abstract away persistence. To your domain code, it feels like working with an in-memory collection—no SQL queries, no database sessions, just clean methods like `save()` and `get()`.

This separation has real benefits:

- **Domain logic stays clean.** It doesn't care if data lives in Postgres, MongoDB, or a JSON file.
- **Testing is trivial.** Swap in an in-memory repository for tests without touching domain code.
- **Storage can evolve.** Switch from SQLite to Redis without rewriting business rules.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Task(BaseModel):
    id: str
    description: str
    completed: bool = False

class Plan(BaseModel):
    id: str
    tasks: list[Task] = Field(default_factory=list)

class PlanRepository(ABC):
    """Domain layer defines the interface."""
    @abstractmethod
    def save(self, plan: Plan) -> None:
        ...

    @abstractmethod
    def get(self, plan_id: str) -> Plan | None:
        ...

class InMemoryPlanRepository(PlanRepository):
    """Infrastructure layer provides the implementation."""
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.storage: dict[str, Plan] = {}

    def save(self, plan: Plan) -> None:
        self.storage[plan.id] = plan

    def get(self, plan_id: str) -> Plan | None:
        return self.storage.get(plan_id)
```

Your domain code only knows about `PlanRepository` (the interface). The infrastructure layer plugs in the actual implementation.

### Domain events

Domain events capture important things that happen in your system. They're named in past tense—`OrderPlaced`, `TaskCompleted`, `PaymentFailed`—because they represent facts.

Events make implicit side effects explicit. Instead of one module directly calling another when something happens, the domain raises an event. Other parts of the system subscribe and react independently.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from pydantic import BaseModel

class TaskCompleted(BaseModel):
    task_id: str
    completed_at: datetime
```

When a task finishes, you emit `TaskCompleted`. A notification service might listen for this event and send an email. A reporting service might log it for analytics. The important part: the task aggregate doesn't need to know about emails or analytics. It just announces what happened.

This decouples workflows and makes cross-context communication clean. It's especially powerful in multi-agent systems where agents react to each other's events.

---

## Translating DDD to agent architectures

AI agents deal with complexity—multi-step workflows, unreliable LLM outputs, evolving requirements. DDD's patterns map surprisingly well to these challenges. Here's how the concepts translate:

### Bounded contexts become agents or skills

Each agent (or major capability) is a bounded context. A research orchestrator might coordinate three specialized agents:

- **Trends Agent** — gathers market data using its own vocabulary and tools
- **Compliance Agent** — runs policy checks with regulatory terminology
- **Cost Agent** — estimates expenses with finance-specific rules

Each has its own model, terminology, and invariants. They communicate through well-defined interfaces or events.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Orchestrator["Research Orchestrator"] --> Trends["Trends Agent<br/>(Market data)"]
  Orchestrator --> Compliance["Compliance Agent<br/>(Policy checks)"]
  Orchestrator --> Cost["Cost Agent<br/>(Estimation)"]
  classDef ctx fill:#e0f2fe,stroke:#38bdf8,color:#0c4a6e;
  class Trends,Compliance,Cost ctx;
```

Even in a single-agent system, you might define internal contexts—a Planning module and an Execution module, each with its own domain model.

### Prompts honor the ubiquitous language

Use domain terms in system prompts, tool descriptions, and function signatures. If compliance experts say "policy check", that exact phrase appears in your prompts and code. This keeps humans and agents synchronized and makes the system easier to review and debug.

### State becomes explicit entities

LLMs are often stateless, but complex agents maintain state—conversation sessions, goals, intermediate results, tool outputs. Model these as entities or value objects:

- `ConversationSession` entity with ID and message history
- `Task` entity representing units of work
- `ToolOutput` value object for immutable results

Explicit modeling enables validation, business rules, and reuse. You can enforce rules like "a task can't be completed until dependencies finish" directly in the entity methods.

### Aggregates express agent plans

A `Plan` aggregate root can govern task lists, enforce limits, and maintain priorities. When an LLM proposes adding 50 tasks, the aggregate enforces a maximum of 10. When it suggests duplicate work, the aggregate rejects it. This keeps AI proposals within business constraints.

### Domain events drive orchestration

Agents raise events—`ResearchCompleted`, `ThresholdExceeded`, `PolicyViolationDetected`. Other agents or services listen and react without tight coupling. This event-driven approach is the future of scalable agent systems: it lets multiple agents collaborate in real-time without being hard-wired together.

### Business rules wrap AI actions

LLM outputs flow through domain services or entity methods. If an LLM suggests a refund amount beyond policy limits, your `RefundRequest` value object validates and rejects it. The AI can improvise, but business rules have the final say. This keeps agents safe and aligned with policy.

---

## Example: a task assistant modeled with DDD

Let's build a personal task assistant that handles requests like "Remind me to buy milk tomorrow" or "What's on my to-do list?" We'll apply DDD principles step by step.

### 1. Map the contexts

Start by breaking the problem into subdomains:

- **Task Management** — handling to-do items and reminders (core domain)
- **Scheduling** — calendar events and meetings
- **Notifications** — sending alerts and emails

We'll focus on Task Management first. The others can evolve as separate bounded contexts or companion agents.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Request] --> B[Task Management]
    B --> C[Scheduling]
    B --> D[Notifications]
    classDef core fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#78350f;
    classDef supporting fill:#e0f2fe,stroke:#38bdf8,color:#0c4a6e;
    class B core;
    class C,D supporting;
```

### 2. Speak the same language

Establish the vocabulary with domain experts (or just common sense for personal tasks): "task", "deadline", "reminder", "priority". Use these exact terms everywhere—prompt templates, method names, UI labels. No translation layers.

### 3. Capture entities, value objects, and events

Now model the core concepts:

- **Entity:** `Task` with identity (`id`) and mutable state (`completed`)
- **Value object:** `Priority` enum (immutable, defined by its value)
- **Domain event:** `TaskCompletedEvent` to signal when work finishes

```python
from datetime import datetime, date
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Priority(Enum):
    """Value object: priority is defined by its value alone."""
    LOW = 1
    NORMAL = 2
    HIGH = 3

class TaskCompletedEvent(BaseModel):
    """Domain event: announces a task was completed."""
    task_id: str
    time: datetime

class Task(BaseModel):
    """Entity: identity persists even as attributes change."""
    id: str
    description: str
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    due_date: date | None = None
    priority: Priority = Priority.NORMAL
    completed: bool = False

    def mark_completed(self) -> TaskCompletedEvent:
        """Business rule: can't complete an already-completed task."""
        if self.completed:
            raise ValueError("Task is already completed.")
        self.completed = True
        return TaskCompletedEvent(task_id=self.id, time=datetime.utcnow())
```

Notice how business rules live in the entity methods, not scattered across prompt templates.

### 4. Shape the aggregate

The `TaskList` is our aggregate root. It holds multiple `Task` entities and enforces consistency rules across them. All modifications go through the root's methods.

```python
from datetime import date
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Task(BaseModel):
    id: str
    description: str
    due_date: date | None = None
    completed: bool = False

class TaskList(BaseModel):
    """Aggregate root: enforces invariants across all tasks."""
    owner: str
    tasks: list[Task] = Field(default_factory=list)

    def add_task(self, task: Task) -> None:
        """Business rule: no duplicate tasks on the same day."""
        if any(
            existing.description == task.description
            and existing.due_date == task.due_date
            for existing in self.tasks
        ):
            raise ValueError("A similar task on that date already exists.")
        self.tasks.append(task)

    def get_pending(self) -> list[Task]:
        """Query helper: find tasks that aren't done yet."""
        return [task for task in self.tasks if not task.completed]


TaskList.model_rebuild()  # Resolve forward references for Pydantic.
```

External code never manipulates `tasks` directly—it always goes through `add_task()` or other root methods. This guarantees the "no duplicates" rule holds.

### 5. Wrap persistence in a repository

The repository abstracts storage. Domain code doesn't know if tasks live in memory, a database, or a JSON file.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class Task(BaseModel):
    id: str
    description: str
    completed: bool = False


class TaskList(BaseModel):
    owner: str
    tasks: list[Task] = Field(default_factory=list)


TaskList.model_rebuild()  # Resolve forward references for Pydantic.


class TaskRepository:
    """Abstracts task storage - in-memory implementation for simplicity."""

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._data: dict[str, TaskList] = {}

    def get_task_list(self, owner: str) -> TaskList:
        """Retrieve a user's task list, or create a new empty one."""
        return self._data.get(owner, TaskList(owner=owner))

    def save_task_list(self, task_list: TaskList) -> None:
        """Persist changes to the task list."""
        self._data[task_list.owner] = task_list
```

In production, you'd swap this for a database implementation—say, using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) or Postgres—without touching the domain logic.

### 6. Run the flow

Here's how everything fits together when a user makes a request:

```python
from datetime import date, timedelta
from uuid import uuid4
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class Task(BaseModel):
    id: str
    description: str
    due_date: date | None = None
    completed: bool = False


class TaskList(BaseModel):
    owner: str
    tasks: list[Task] = Field(default_factory=list)

    def add_task(self, task: Task) -> None:
        if any(
            existing.description == task.description
            and existing.due_date == task.due_date
            for existing in self.tasks
        ):
            raise ValueError("A similar task on that date already exists.")
        self.tasks.append(task)


class TaskRepository:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._data: dict[str, TaskList] = {}

    def get_task_list(self, owner: str) -> TaskList:
        return self._data.get(owner, TaskList(owner=owner))

    def save_task_list(self, task_list: TaskList) -> None:
        self._data[task_list.owner] = task_list


TaskList.model_rebuild()  # Resolve forward references for Pydantic.


# User says: "Remind me to buy milk tomorrow"
# (In reality, an LLM would parse this into structured data)
user_input = "Remind me to buy milk tomorrow"
intent = "add_task"

# Initialize repository
repo = TaskRepository()

if intent == "add_task":
    # 1. Load the user's task list
    task_list = repo.get_task_list(owner="User123")

    # 2. Create a new task entity
    task = Task(
        id=str(uuid4()),
        description="buy milk",
        due_date=date.today() + timedelta(days=1),
    )

    # 3. Domain layer enforces business rules
    try:
        task_list.add_task(task)
        repo.save_task_list(task_list)
        print(f"Task '{task.description}' added for {task.due_date}.")
    except Exception as exc:
        print(f"Sorry, I couldn't add that task: {exc}")
```

Notice the separation of concerns:

- **LLM layer** parses natural language into structured data (intent + parameters)
- **Domain layer** enforces business rules through entity methods
- **Repository layer** handles persistence without leaking into domain logic

The LLM can be creative with parsing, but the domain ensures consistency. If the LLM tries to add a duplicate task, the aggregate root rejects it—no special-casing needed in prompts.

## Tooling to bring the model to life

DDD doesn't require special frameworks, but certain tools make implementation smoother—especially for AI agents.

### FastAPI

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) pairs beautifully with DDD. Use routers to separate bounded contexts (`/tasks`, `/schedule`), Pydantic models for request/response validation, and dependency injection to wire up repositories.

Structure your project in layers:

```text
project/
├── domain/          # Pure business logic (entities, aggregates, value objects)
├── application/     # Use cases and command handlers
├── infrastructure/  # Repositories, databases, external APIs
└── interface/       # FastAPI routers and HTTP contracts
```

This layering (sometimes called "onion architecture") keeps changes from rippling through your codebase. Swap the database? Touch only `infrastructure/`. Change the UI? Touch only `interface/`.

### Pydantic and Pydantic AI

[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) enforces invariants and validates data at runtime. Use it for entities, value objects, and especially for validating LLM outputs.

[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) takes this further: it ensures LLM responses conform to your domain schemas. Define an `AddTaskCommand` with required fields, and Pydantic AI validates that the LLM's JSON output matches before you act on it. This brings structure to the chaotic world of AI outputs.

### DDD helper libraries

- **[DDDesign](https://pypi.org/project/dddesign/)** — provides base classes for entities, repositories, and value objects built on Pydantic
- **[Protean](https://github.com/proteanhq/protean)** — a full framework for DDD, CQRS, and event sourcing if you want something that comes with a lot of ready-made features out of the box

Most Python developers skip these and use vanilla classes with Pydantic, but they're worth exploring for large projects.

### Event-driven tooling

For domain events, consider:

- **[blinker](https://github.com/jek/blinker)** — lightweight in-process event dispatcher
- **[redis-py Pub/Sub](https://github.com/redis/redis-py)** or **[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)** — for distributed events across services or agents
- **asyncio event patterns** — if you're already async

Events are crucial for multi-agent orchestration. An agent emits `ResearchCompleted`, others react—no tight coupling.

### Agent frameworks

[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack), [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index), [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), [Google ADK](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/agent-developer-kit), [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents), and [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) provide structure for modern agent workflows. Use them within your domain layer, but wrap them in your own interfaces. That way, swapping frameworks doesn't break your business logic.

### Testing

One of DDD's biggest wins: your domain layer tests without the whole stack running.

- **[PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)** for unit tests on entities and aggregates
- **Fake repositories** (in-memory) for integration tests
- **LLM stubs** that return predetermined outputs

Your domain code should never require a live LLM to test. The LLM is an implementation detail—your tests validate business rules.

---

## Getting started checklist

Ready to apply DDD to your next agent project? Here's your roadmap:

1. **Interview domain experts.** Draft the ubiquitous language—the vocabulary everyone will use. Document it.
2. **Map bounded contexts.** Draw the subdomains and mark where they need to talk to each other. Start with one core context.
3. **Model entities and value objects.** What things have identity? What things are just values? Bake invariants into their methods.
4. **Define aggregate roots.** Bundle related entities under one root that enforces consistency rules.
5. **Create repository interfaces.** Don't implement storage yet—just define `save()` and `get()` methods. Keep the domain clean.
6. **Emit domain events.** For meaningful changes (order placed, task completed), raise events. Wire listeners later as needed.
7. **Wrap LLM outputs in schemas.** Use Pydantic models to enforce contracts. Don't let free-form text leak into your domain.
8. **Add orchestration.** Build application services that coordinate agents via structured commands or events.

The golden rule: **start with the domain, not the tech stack.** Understand the business problem first. Model it explicitly. Then let the AI tooling serve that model—not the other way around.
