# About Me

👋 Hi, I'm **Slava Dubrov** — a Machine Learning Tech Lead with 10+ years of shipping production AI systems.

## Why You Should Read This Blog

I write about **what actually works** in production AI systems — not theory, not hype, but patterns tested at scale. My perspective comes from:

- **Building the Context Layer for AI Agents at HubSpot** — designing the infrastructure that keeps agents grounded, efficient, and compliant
- **Saving companies millions** — $4M+ yearly at Wayfair alone through fraud/scam detection and embedding systems I built and led
- **Publishing research** — PhD in AI diagnostics, peer-reviewed publications, and patents in intelligent systems
- **Hands-on with the full stack** — from data pipelines and model training to evaluation, deployment, and safety guardrails
- **Cloud ML architecture expertise** — designing and deploying AI systems across AWS and GCP as batch, streaming, and real-time services

When I share a technique like [Schema-Guided Reasoning](/blog/2025/12/25/schema-guided-reasoning-on-vllm--turning-llms-into-reliable-business-logic-engines/) or [Context Engineering patterns](/blog/2025/10/05/context-engineering-in-the-agenticai-era--and-how-to-cook-it/), it's because I've validated it in real systems with real stakes.

## Current Focus

At **HubSpot** (Tech Lead ML II), I'm building:

- **Embedding Hub** — production vector infrastructure on Qdrant powering semantic search and personalization
- **Context Layer for AI Agents** — building systems that generate actionable context and insights for HubSpot's agents using a combination of retrieval, embeddings, and reasoning techniques

I lead cross-functional ML teams, mentor engineers, and partner with product and go-to-market stakeholders to launch customer-facing AI features globally.
