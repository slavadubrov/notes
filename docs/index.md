ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Slava!

I'm a Berlinâ€‘based **Senior Machine Learning Engineerâ€¯II at HubSpot** (PhD) with 10+ years of experience turning cuttingâ€‘edge research into reliable, revenueâ€‘generating products.

I've built graphâ€‘neuralâ€‘network fraud detection systems that save millions at Wayfair, largeâ€‘scale recommender systems and statistical experimentation tooling at OLXâ€¯Group, and now lead AI Signals initiatives at HubSpot.

My professional passions include fraudâ€¯&â€¯scam detection, representation learning, recommender systems, **LLMsâ€¯&â€¯AIâ€¯agents**, and MLOpsâ€”topics you'll find explored throughout this blog.

My goal is to create a valuable resource for fellow practitioners and anyone interested in the real-world application of machine learning.
