# Shared Intelligence

> Practical lessons from building ML systems that scale.

👋 Hi, I'm Slava!

I’m a Machine Learning Engineering Tech Lead II at HubSpot with 10+ years of experience shipping production AI systems across embeddings, recommender systems, LLM-powered applications, forecasting, churn detection, scam and fraud prevention. Right now I’m building **Embedding Hub** on top of Qdrant and establishing a **Context Layer** that helps AI agents stay grounded, efficient, and compliant.

I lead cross-functional ML teams, mentor engineers, and partner with product, data, and go-to-market stakeholders to launch customer-facing AI features worldwide. I thrive at the intersection of infrastructure and product—owning the roadmap from data pipelines and model lifecycle to agent orchestration, evaluation, and safety guardrails.

Day to day, I stay focused on embedding systems, retrieval quality, LLM evaluation, and agentic workflows—experimenting with Google ADK, FastMCP, LlamaIndex, LangGraph, CrewAI, and SmolAgents to push new ideas into production-ready form.

I write here about practical aspects of developing LLM applications and AI agents, and I stay active in the broader community through mentorship and knowledge sharing.

Check out my experiments on GitHub: [github.com/slavadubrov](https://github.com/slavadubrov).

If you're exploring LLM-powered products, agent frameworks, or robust ML platforms, let's connect—I'm always happy to swap ideas.
